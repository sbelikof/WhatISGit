I was born on the steps of the Berlin Flughafen to scene beyond imagining:
while I do not remember this, my parents fondly recall the Musik being played
by a street performer with a harp and the meaty allure of brotwurst
fried to perfection in a nearby vat. They would later tell me how they 
met while getting betrunken at a local biergarten with Rammstein playing in the 
1background.
