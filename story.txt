I was born on the steps of the Berlin Flughafen to scene beyond imagining:
while I do not remember this, my parents fondly recall the Musik being played
by a street performer with a harp and the meaty allure of brotwurst
fried to perfection in a nearby vat. 
They would later tell me how they met while getting betrunken at a local biergarten 
with Rammstein playing in the background. 
I was surprised to find my Lederhose unplugged, so I Gebaecked the Ratskeller and that 
seemed restore power to the Gauss-Hund.
My Porsche replied with the wrong message, which led me to Berlin with nothing left.
I was on the Hauptstrasse and decided to stop at the local Baeckerei for a Brot.
Afterwards, I took a trip to the Flughafen in Berlin.
The dull rattle of the Klimaanlage aboard the plane along with the constant Hund
barking kept me up all the way to Munich.
It wasn't till much later that I found there was a layover in Lederhose which meant
I was going to be late reaching the ratskeller.
Sprinting to my Audi, I made my way off the Hauptstrasse and started flapping my wings.
My trusty built in klimaanlage kept me from getting too sweaty.
